# Medical-Insurance-Price-Prediction

Overview 
--------

This projects is focused on predicting medical insurance price using regression. Data was collected from Kaggle and cleaned for Exploratory Data Analysis 
using Statistical Analysis and Feature Engineering. Transformation pipelines were implemented for convenient preprocessing of existing and new data. Machine
Learning techniques such as Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Support Vector Regression and Random Forest Regression were
applied for creation of models and cross-validation was used to evaluate their performance. Hyperparameter Tuning was applied to improve performance of some
of the models. Finally the project aims to deploy the trained models, although this step is not yet completed.

Primary Objective 
----------------- 

To develop regression models that accurately predict the medical insurance cost for an individual based on their personal information like age, sex, BMI, number of children, region and their lifestyle habits such as smoking using the dataset available on Kaggle. R^2 score will be used to evaluate model performance and the best performing model will be deployed for educational purposes.
