# Medical-Insurance-Price-Prediction

This projects is focused on predicting medical insurance price using regression. Data was collected from Kaggle and cleaned for Exploratory Data Analysis 
using Statistical Analysis and Feature Engineering. Transformation pipelines were implemented for convenient preprocessing of existing and new data. Machine
Learning techniques such as Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Support Vector Regression and Random Forest Regression were
applied for creation of models and cross-validation was used to evaluate their performance. Hyperparameter Tuning was applied to improve performance of some
of the models. Finally the project aims to deploy the trained models, although this step is not yet completed.
